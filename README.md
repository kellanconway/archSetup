as the name implies, this is just a little shell script to help setup arch

I made this repo mostly for me so I can use curl on a fresh install

in case you want to try it for yourself 

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellanconway/archSetup/main/archSetup.bash && \
chmod +x archSetup.bash && \
./archSetup.bash
```
